# BMI8130-2021

This is the repository for the **Analysis and Applications of Genome-Scale Data** course  (BMI8130 on Autumn 2021)

## Course description

The goal of this course is to introduce trainees to the fundamental algorithms needed to understand and analyze genome-scale expression data sets. Special focus will be on single-cell data analysis. The course will cover three major categories: 

1. fundamental and advanced big-data analysis in solving real biological problems
2. behind the scene: classic and cutting-edge algorithms/methods for tool development
3. in-hand practice of using tools and data analysis. The course will include an introduction to, and hands-on experience with, the R statistical software environment and the use of R packages that can be applied to these kinds of problems
